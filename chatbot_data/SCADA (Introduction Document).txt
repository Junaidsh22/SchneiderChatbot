Q: What is SCADA?
A: SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) is an industrial control system that allows operators to monitor, control, and manage critical processes—much like a control tower for an industrial facility.

Q: How is SCADA used in industry?
A: It helps users supervise operations, adjust equipment, and analyse real-time data across systems such as water treatment, power distribution, manufacturing, and oil & gas.

Q: What are the main components of SCADA?
A:
• Supervisory Function – Monitors operations and ensures nothing is overlooked.
• Control Capabilities – Allows operators to adjust pumps, motors, loops, and system parameters.
• Data Acquisition – Collects and analyses real-time data such as measurements, fluid levels, and system performance.

Q: What is the purpose of SCADA?
A: SCADA gives operators a complete view of how processes are running, enabling faster decisions, improved efficiency, and better control over complex systems.

Q: Where is SCADA used in real-world applications?
A:
• Water & Wastewater – Controls pumps, monitors quality, and manages chemical dosing.
• Power Grids – Ensures stable electricity flow and monitors grid sections.
• Oil & Gas – Tracks pipeline pressure and storage levels.
• Manufacturing – Oversees production lines and product quality.

Q: How does SCADA work in practice?
A: Sensors collect data from equipment and field devices. This information is sent through communication networks to SCADA software, where operators view real-time data, control systems, identify issues, and optimise processes.

Q: What is the main takeaway about SCADA?
A: SCADA is a powerful tool that helps businesses understand and control their operations, but human operators are always required to interpret data and make decisions. It supports, enhances, and streamlines operations rather than replacing human control.
