SCADA INTRODUCTION & WHAT IT IS

WHAT IS SCADA & HOW IS IT USED:
Like a Control tower for a industrial facility
 (It helps user monitor and control critical processes) 
Imagine a smart home system but on a huge scale (Fe: phone to adjust heating temperature, in a SCADA this is covered for water, distribution and manufacturing.

SCADA BROKEN DOWN:
Supervisory Function – The eyes and ears of SCADA it watches and keeps track of all smaller operation so nothing is oversight/missed
Control Capabilities – It lets operators adjust anything in the system on the go: motors, pumps, loops etc 
Data acquisition – Collects and analyses real time data (Measurements, fluid levels etc)
The aim is to give ground operators a direct inside into how everything is running

PRACTICAL APPLICATION:
In water it manages: Quality, controls pumps and monitors chemical dosing
In power grids: It ensures electricity flows smoothly and keeps tabs on subsections 
In oil & gas: It monitors pipeline pressure & monitors storage levels 
In manufacturing: all about maintaining product lines and the overall product quality  

HOW IT WORKS IN THE REAL WORLD:
Using sensors on the ground which are connected to everything which allows data collection and monitoring. The communication aspect is then used to control and link up all individual parts while the operators can in real time monitor the overall production using data and analysis to fix bugs and streamline the overall process when needed

OVERVIEW (TAKEAWAY INFORMATION):
Essentially it’s a tool to integrate into a business to have a better understanding of overall operations, features and manageability of a overall system 
SCADA is very skilled but needs people the ‘human operators’ to analyse and understand the data it produces to forge a better path/plan in the future from the data
(Always a human control at the end) – its just a empowering tool we need that businesses can use to better manage and control their overall business needs!
