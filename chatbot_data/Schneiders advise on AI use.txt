Schneiders advise on AI use

AI is a toolbox, not a replacement — it helps us perform specific tasks like predicting machine lifecycles, streamlining maintenance, and improving documentation.

Used across sectors to enhance speed, quality, and sustainability — from large-scale plant operations to everyday tasks like summarising emails or generating reports.

AI @ Scale is Schneider Electric’s initiative to bring AI to the forefront for customers and employees, driving energy efficiency and smarter operations.

Customer impact: Optimising energy use, reducing costs, and enabling greener, scalable transformation.

Employee impact: Simplifying routines, improving safety, reducing maintenance, and enhancing decision-making through data-driven insights.

AI needs quality data — better data means better predictions. But AI can make mistakes, so outputs must be verified.

Responsible use is key: Only public data should be used, and employees must be trained to prompt effectively and ethically.

AI is not autonomous — it requires human direction, understanding, and oversight to be truly effective.
