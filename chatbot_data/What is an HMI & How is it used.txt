Q: What is an HMI?
A: An HMI (Human-Machine Interface) is a system that allows operators to interact with machines through a visual interface, enabling monitoring, control, and diagnostics.

Q: What are the core functions of an HMI?
A:
• Monitoring machine status
• Controlling operations (start/stop, adjusting settings)
• Diagnosing faults and performance issues
• Visualising PLC data and process information

Q: What is a simple real-world analogy for an HMI?
A: An ATM. Users give commands through a screen and buttons, the machine performs actions, and it provides feedback — just like an industrial HMI.

Q: In which industries are HMIs commonly used?
A: Manufacturing, energy and utilities, water treatment, food and beverage, oil and gas, and pharmaceuticals.

Q: What information do HMIs typically display?
A: Temperatures, pressures, tank levels, flow rates, process counts, alarms, and warnings.

Q: How do HMIs integrate with PLCs?
A: HMIs display real-time PLC logic and data, allow control of machine functions, and reduce the need for laptops during troubleshooting.

Q: What communication protocols do HMIs use?
A: Common protocols include Modbus, Ethernet/IP, Profibus, Profinet, and CANopen.

Q: What key features do HMIs offer?
A:
• Remote monitoring
• Multi-machine control
• Direct control of pumps, valves, and motors
• Alarm management
• Data logging for historical analysis
