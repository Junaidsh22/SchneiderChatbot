What is an HMI?

HMI stands for Human-Machine Interface — a system that allows operators to interact with machines through a visual and control interface.

Core Functions:

•	Monitor machine status
•	Control operations (start/stop, adjust settings)
•	Diagnose faults and performance issues
•	Visualize PLC logic and process data

Think of it as the “dashboard” of a machine, just like a car dashboard shows speed, fuel, and alerts.

Real-World Analogy: ATM Machine
An ATM is a perfect example of an HMI:
•	You input commands via buttons and screen
•	The machine responds with actions (withdrawal, balance check)
•	It provides feedback and status — just like industrial HMIs

Industrial Applications of HMIs

HMIs are used across virtually every industry, including:

•	Manufacturing
•	Energy & Utilities
•	Water Treatment
•	Food & Beverage
•	Oil & Gas
•	Pharmaceuticals

What HMIs Display:
•	Temperature
•	Pressure
•	Tank levels
•	Flow rates
•	Process counts
•	Alarms and warnings



Customization & Software

HMIs are programmable using specialized software tailored to each manufacturer:
•	Schneider Electric – Vijeo Designer
•	Siemens – WinCC
•	Rockwell Automation – FactoryTalk View
•	Mitsubishi – GT Designer

Customization Includes:
•	Button layout
•	Screen architecture
•	Machine connectivity
•	Alarm systems
•	User permissions
Engineers can design HMIs to match client needs, making them highly flexible and scalable.

Integration with PLCs

HMIs are tightly integrated with Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) to:
•	Display real-time logic and data
•	Control machine operations
•	Reduce need for laptops during troubleshooting

Communication Protocols:
•	Modbus
•	Ethernet/IP
•	Profibus
•	Profinet
•	CANopen
These protocols ensure seamless communication between HMI, PLC, and machinery.
