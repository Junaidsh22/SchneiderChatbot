What is an HMI?
HMI stands for Human-Machine Interface — a system that allows operators to interact with machines through a visual and control interface.

Core Functions:
•	Monitor machine status
•	Control operations (start/stop, adjust settings)
•	Diagnose faults and performance issues
•	Visualize PLC logic and process data

Think of it as the “dashboard” of a machine, just like a car dashboard shows speed, fuel, and alerts.

Real-World Analogy: ATM Machine

An ATM is a perfect example of an HMI:
•	You input commands via buttons and screen
•	The machine responds with actions (withdrawal, balance check)
•	It provides feedback and status — just like industrial HMIs

INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS:
•	Manufacturing
•	Energy & Utilities
•	Water Treatment
•	Food & Beverage
•	Oil & Gas
•	Pharmaceuticals

WHAT THEY DISPLAY:
•	Temperature
•	Pressure
•	Tank levels
•	Flow rates
•	Process counts
•	Alarms and warnings


HOW THEY INTEGRATE WITH PLCS:
•	Display real-time logic and data
•	Control machine operations
•	Reduce need for laptops during troubleshooting

Communication Protocols:
•	Modbus
•	Ethernet/IP
•	Profibus
•	Profinet
•	CANopen
These protocols ensure seamless communication between HMI, PLC, and machinery.

FEATURE DESCRIPTION OF HMI'S:
Remote Monitoring	View and control machines from off-site
Multi-Machine Control	Manage several machines from one HMI
Real-World Control	Operate pumps, valves, motors directly
Alarm Management	Set thresholds and receive alerts
Data Logging	Record historical data for analysis
