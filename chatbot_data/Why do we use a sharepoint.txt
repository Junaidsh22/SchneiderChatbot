Why do we use a sharepoint?

Below are a detailed range of reasons for why we use a sharepoint?

- Centralied Repository
SharePoint acts as a single source of truth for all company documents—policies, templates, reports, technical guides—reducing duplication and confusion.

- Easy Access & Search
Built-in search functionality lets users quickly find documents by keywords, tags, or metadata.
Supports filters and refiners (e.g., by department, document type, last updated), making navigation intuitive.

- Collaboration & Version Control
Multiple users can co-author documents in real time.
Automatic version history ensures older versions are archived and changes are tracked—critical for compliance and audits.



- Remote Accessibility 
Cloud-based access means employees can retrieve documents securely from anywhere—ideal for hybrid or global teams.
