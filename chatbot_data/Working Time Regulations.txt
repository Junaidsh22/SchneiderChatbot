Working time = time spent to client, training, being on call, and normally working (Being online at home)

Can be paid towards time spent travelling to non-office site 
For homeworkers or travelling appointments – travel counts as working time (but not to your local office)
On Call time only calls when you are on the site

My contract is 35 hours per week + 30-minute lunch. (37.5 in total)
Managers are trained to understand how to support your team – and are encouraged to take a proactive approach to working time etc.
